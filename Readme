# Discount Calculator

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## Features

* Prompts the user to enter the original price and discount percentage.
* Applies the discount only if it is **20% or higher**.
* If the discount is less than 20%, the original price is returned.

## How It Works

1. The program defines a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that:

   * Checks if the discount percentage is greater than or equal to 20.
   * If yes, it applies the discount to the original price.
   * If no, it returns the original price without changes.
2. The user is prompted to input:

   * The original price of the item.
   * The discount percentage.
3. The program then displays the final price.

## Example Run

```
Enter the original price: 1000  
Enter the discount percentage: 25  
Final price after discount: 750.0  
```
